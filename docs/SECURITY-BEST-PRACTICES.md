## Pipeline Security

### Source Code Management

- **Branch Protection**: Enforce branch protection rules to prevent direct pushes to main branches
- **Required Reviews**: Require pull request reviews from at least one or more teammates
- **Status Checks**: Require successful CI checks before merging
- **Signed Commits**: Enforce commit signing with GPG or SSH keys
- **Code Owners**: Implement CODEOWNERS file to define ownership and review requirements

### CI/CD Platform Security

- **Runner Security**:
  - Use ephemeral runners/agents that start fresh for each job
  - Update runners regularly with security patches
  - Run jobs in isolated environments (containers, VMs)
  
- **Pipeline Definition Security**:
  - Store pipeline definitions as code in the repository
  - Review pipeline definitions in pull requests
  - Validate pipeline definitions before execution
  
- **Third-Party Actions/Plugins**:
  - Pin third-party actions to specific SHA commits, not tags or branches
  - Regularly audit third-party actions/plugins
  - Consider maintaining an internal allowlist of approved actions
  
- **Pipeline Execution**:
  - Implement timeouts for all jobs
  - Set resource limits (CPU, memory) for jobs
  - Isolate sensitive workloads from public runners

## Infrastructure Security

### Infrastructure as Code Security

- **IaC Scanning**: Implement security scanning for Terraform/CloudFormation
- **Policy as Code**: Enforce security policies with tools like OPA, Sentinel, or Checkov
- **Least Privilege**: Use minimal permissions for all infrastructure changes
- **State File Security**: Secure IaC state files (encryption, access control)

### Deployment Security

- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Use immutable infrastructure patterns
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Scan infrastructure components for vulnerabilities
- **Network Security**:
  - Implement proper network segmentation
  - Use security groups and firewalls appropriately
  - Encrypt data in transit with TLS
- **Configuration Hardening**: Apply security best practices to all components

## Application Security

### Dependency Management

- **Dependency Scanning**: Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
- **Version Pinning**: Pin dependency versions for consistency
- **License Compliance**: Check for license compliance in dependencies
- **Outdated Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies

### Code Security

- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**: Implement static code analysis
- **Code Quality**: Enforce code quality standards with linters
- **Security Linting**: Use security-specific linters for common issues

### Container Security

- **Image Scanning**: Scan container images for vulnerabilities
- **Minimal Base Images**: Use minimal/distroless base images
- **Non-Root Users**: Run containers as non-root users
- **Image Signing**: Sign container images for verification
- **Image Tags**: Use specific image tags, preferably digests

### Application Testing

- **Security Testing**: Implement security-focused tests
- **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**: Run dynamic security testing
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular penetration testing
- **Fuzz Testing**: Implement fuzzing for critical components

## Secrets Management

### Secret Storage

- **Dedicated Secret Store**: Use a dedicated secret management solution (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Never hardcode secrets in code or configs
- **Encryption**: Encrypt secrets at rest and in transit
- **Temporary Credentials**: Use short-lived credentials when possible

### Secret Access

- **Just-in-Time Access**: Provide secrets just-in-time for pipeline steps
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimal necessary access to secrets
- **Rotation**: Rotate secrets regularly
- **Audit**: Audit secret access

### Secret Detection

- **Secret Scanning**: Implement scanning to detect accidental secret commits
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Use pre-commit hooks to prevent committing secrets
- **Post-commit Scanning**: Scan repositories for leaked secrets

## Access Control

### Identity and Authentication

- **Strong Authentication**: Use strong authentication methods
- **MFA/2FA**: Enforce multi-factor authentication for all accounts
- **Service Accounts**: Use dedicated service accounts for automated processes
- **Federation**: Implement identity federation where appropriate

### Authorization

- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimal necessary permissions
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC for all systems
- **Just-in-Time Access**: Grant temporary elevated permissions when needed
- **Regular Review**: Regularly review and audit access permissions

### Environment Separation

- **Environment Isolation**: Separate development, staging, and production
- **Production Access Control**: Implement strict controls for production access
- **Approval Gates**: Require approvals for sensitive environment deployments

## Compliance and Auditing

### Audit Logging

- **Comprehensive Logging**: Log all pipeline activities
- **Log Protection**: Protect logs from tampering
- **Log Retention**: Retain logs according to compliance requirements
- **Log Analysis**: Regularly analyze logs for security incidents

### Compliance Checks

- **Automated Compliance**: Implement automated compliance checks
- **Policy Enforcement**: Enforce security policies in pipelines
- **Attestation**: Generate attestations for auditing purposes
- **Evidence Collection**: Collect evidence for compliance requirements

### Regular Audits

- **Pipeline Audits**: Regularly audit pipeline configurations
- **Permission Audits**: Audit access permissions
- **Vulnerability Audits**: Audit for known vulnerabilities
- **External Audits**: Conduct external security audits periodically

## Incident Response

### Detection

- **Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring for all components
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implement anomaly detection in pipelines

### Response Plan

- **Incident Playbooks**: Create incident response playbooks
- **Automated Remediation**: Implement automated remediation where possible
- **Communication**: Establish clear communication channels for incidents
- **Practice**: Regularly practice incident response procedures

### Recovery

- **Rollback Capability**: Ensure ability to quickly roll back changes
- **Backup Strategy**: Implement comprehensive backup strategy
- **Disaster Recovery**: Plan for disaster recovery scenarios
